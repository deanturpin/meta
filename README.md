# How to leave Meta

"He who does not move, does not notice his chains" -- Rosa Luxemburg

## Common reasons for not worrying about privacy

> I have nothing to hide

[Edward Snowden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk) explains why this is a bad argument: you have nothing to hide whilst you agree with the person with the stick.

> I'm not doing anything wrong

Rules change and you have no input.

## Meta's changing policies

> We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words such as "weird".
