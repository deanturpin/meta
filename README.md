# How to leave Meta

With the three Musk-ateers in Trump's pocket, ask yourself: "What's the worst that can happen?"

## Why now?

It kinda feels like it could be the start of something big. It absolutely doesn't seem a stretch that Trump could demand access to all our messages to protect us from the bad men. But if you minimise your digital exposure and all this blows over, what will you have missed? A lot of cat videos? You will definitely have learnt a lot about how your data are used and abused.

## Common reasons for not worrying about privacy

> I have nothing to hide

[Edward Snowden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk) explains why this is a bad argument: you have nothing to hide whilst you agree with the person with the stick.

> I'm not doing anything wrong

Rules change and you have no input.

Addionally, you are assuming the data gatherers will maintain its integrity once it has been picked apart, repackaged and resold.

> I'm not doing anything _really_ wrong like dealing drugs or something

Whilst it is probably true you are not on the FBI's most wanted list, you are still being tracked and profiled. Mortgage lenders and employers might be super interested to know you are hitting the casino every evening, or are flagged as having some health issue. The nothing-to-hide crew ought to consider that there is no discussion as to _why_ you have been declined a loan.

## Using Meta plaforms to promote your business

This is tricky as it's difficult justify reducing your reach; especially if you're not overwhelmed with work.

## Meta's changing policies

> We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words such as "weird".

## Download your data

It's tempting to just delete your accounts in a fit of pique, but there is an argument to keeping your username to avoid impersonation.

The Facebook download took about 6 hours to prepare and was approximately 5GB for 10+ years of posts, so make sure you're not leaving it to the last minute.

- [Facebook](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions): make sure to select full date range and high quality media; also [logout of all devices](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/password_and_security/login_activity) so you don't accidentally check it on your phone browser

## Remove the phone apps

You are not completely free from any data gathering but you can at least reduce your exposure -- and quality of data captured -- by limiting the use of services to your laptop where possible. Do you really need to post all your photos just after they're taken? Are you reporting breaking news/current affairs, or can it wait until you get home and edit them nicely?

## Search engines

Google was once the developers' friend but now it is a vast, nebulous beast. And it purvades everything, tracking your every move and profiting from it; but its creep has been so methodically slow that we've barely even noticed.

You can at least make the [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) search engine your browser default.

## VPN

I use ExpressVPN on my phone and you don't really notice and drop in (network) performance if you pick a geographically close server. But you will find you suddenly start getting Norwegian ads, which is quite fun anyway. Of course you cannot implicitly trust the VPN provider either, but it is another layer to the obscurity onion. Which leads us nicely onto the Tor browser, which runs on the Tor Onion network.

## DNS servers

This is getting into the weeds a bit, but... behind the scenes when you type a URL, there is a lookup of that name to an IP address which is used to route your request to the web server where your website really lives. If you haven't fiddled with it this is probably Google: `8.8.8.8`. Therefore, despite your data being encrypted, all top level websites that you visit are tracked by Google, even if you didn't search for it.

An alternative is Cloudflare: `1.1.1.1`.
