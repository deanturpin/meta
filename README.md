# How to leave Meta

##Â Why now?

With the three Musk-ateers in Trump's pocket, ask yourself: what's the worst that can happen?

It kinda feels like it could be the start of something big.

But if you minimise your digital exposure and all this blows over, what will you have missed? A lot of cat videos? You will definitely have learnt a lot about how your data are (mis)used.

## The tech giants

- Google
- Apple
- Amazon
- Meta
- Microsoft
- Tesla

## Search engines

Google was once the friend of the developers but not it's become this vast nebulous entity. And it purvades everything, tracking your every move and profiting from it. But it has crept so slowly that we've barely noticed.

## Common reasons for not worrying about privacy

> I have nothing to hide

[Edward Snowden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk) explains why this is a bad argument: you have nothing to hide whilst you agree with the person with the stick.

> I'm not doing anything wrong

Rules change and you have no input.

Addionally, you are assuming the data gathers will maintain the integrity of your data once it has been picked apart, repackaged and resold.

## Using Meta plaforms to promote your business

This is tricky as it's difficult justify reducing your reach; especially if you're not fully booked.

## Meta's changing policies

> We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words such as "weird".

## Remove the phone apps

You are not completely free from any data gathering but you can at least reduce your exposure -- and quality of data captured -- and limiting the use of services to your laptop where possible.
